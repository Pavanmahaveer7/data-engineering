Project about Data Engineering
Here I am desribing about Data Engineering Project where we are using Apache Kafka, Aifflow and Cassandra.

(https://github.com/Pavanmahaveer7/data-engineering/assets/79128839/a7ba600e-ffdd-4644-9b3a-46692fc508a1)


I would be discussing about each component and its use here then, the main aim of our project. 

**Technologies used:
**
**Cassandra**: A distributed NoSQL database that provides high availability and scalability for large amounts of structured data.

**Airflow**: An open source workflow management platform used to author, schedule and monitor data pipelines.

**Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform that publishes and subscribes data streams and stores them fault-tolerantly.

These three can be connected in a data pipeline where Kafka ingests real-time data streams, Cassandra stores the processed data, and Airflow orchestrates and manages the ETL jobs and workflow between Kafka and Cassandra.
